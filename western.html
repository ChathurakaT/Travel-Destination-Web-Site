    <h2> Western Province </h2>

    <h4>The Western Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.</h4>
    <h3>Kalutara Bodhiya</h3>
    <p>The Southern coast of Sri Lanka is dotted with numerous attractions but in the popular town of Kalutara, about 60KM from central Colombo, is a religious site that brings people from all walks of life together. Attracting hundreds of Buddhists, tourists and travellers curious to experience a unique culture, the Kalutara Bodhiya is one of the most prominent Buddhist temples in the country, housing two Bodhi trees; one on the upper terrace next to the Chaithya, and one on the lower terrace next to Galle Road.

        It is said that the Bodhi tree on the upper terrace grew from one of the 32 saplings from the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Anuradhapura. The lower terrace hosts a Bodhi tree that grew from one of the eight saplings that originated from the Sri Maha Bodhi tree that Lord Buddha sat under to attain Enlightenment. For this reason, Sri Lankans from all over the country make it a point to pause at the Kalutara Bodhiya whenever they pass by and pay their respects.
        
        It is a beautiful sight to see, villagers and city-folk alike, clad in white, converging at the entrance of the temple with colourful bunches of flowers as tribute. From Nelum flowers to Araliya to Jasmine, it is customary to bring a few to be placed at the Chaithya as a sign of reverence. Further, no vehicle passes by the Bodhiya without stopping to contribute a few rupees to the donation tills. Whether it is a truck driver making a long-haul journey to deliver goods or a group of friends travelling down-south for vacation, each vehicle pauses to drop a few coins into the till for prosperity, good luck and protection.
        
        Walking into the Kalutara Bodhiya is an experience like no other. Acting as a sacred place of worship since the 2nd century BC, the Kalutara Bodhiya has withstood Portuguese, Dutch and English rule, as well as multiple other obstacles that Sri Lanka has faced, and still stands tall and peaceful in all its glory. With the soft ghatha chants wafting through the air, the calm nature of focused worshippers, and the soft breeze that constantly blows through the temple, the Bodhiya stands as a safe haven to many, embodying peace, unity and tranquility.</p>
    <h3>Kelaniya Temple</h3>    
    <p> Kelaniya Temple built on the banks of the Kelaniya River is one of the most sacred sites of Sri Lanka. It is believed Buddha together with 500 Arahats (Supremely enlightened beings) visited Kelaniya on the Wesek day of the Buddhist Era 2531 and expounding of the Dhamma, the Buddhist doctrine to the inhabitants of the island.

        Buddha’s timely visit to the island resulted in quelling an imminent war between two kings named Chulodara and Mahodara over a jewel–encrusted throne. Buddha having preached the doctrine on the disputed throne offered to him ensued lasting peace between the two kings. The great stupa built upon the site enshrining the throne was since then called Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara.Kelaniya Temple believed to had been built in the era prior to the chronologically recorded history of Sir Lanka (since 543 B.C) was renovated by Prince Uttiya, brother of King Devanampiyatissa following the arrival Arahat Mahinda in 307 BC. According to the Mahawansa, King Devanampiyatissa’s brother Uttiya renovated the vihara for the first time. Prince Uttiya also built the first ever residential quarters of the Buddhist monks (Sanghawasa) there.

        The ancient temple was destroyed time and again by the Dravidian invaders from Southern India. Each time the temple had been reconstructed. The medieval temple was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1510 yet reconstructed by King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha in the year 1967. New Temple was initiated in 1927 and completed in 1946 under the patronage of philanthropist Mrs. Helena WijewardeneThe entrance to the temple yard is over the park across the main street. The arched grill gate opens upto the lower terrace of the temple yard. The lower terrace leads four sets of flight of steps in four carinal directions to the Upper terrace which features the Image Hose, Dagaba and the Bo Tree (Peepal tree) with other buildings..</p>
