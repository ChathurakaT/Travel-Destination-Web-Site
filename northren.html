        Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil is one of the most significant Hindu temples in the Jaffna district.  Its history goes back to several centuries. It is believed that the first Temple was originally built in 948 A.D, due to foreign invasion the Temple had to be re-constructed number of times in different places. The third temple was built in the 15th century by Senpaha Perumal the adopted son of Bhuvanekababhu, the king of Kotte. It was destroyed by the Portuguese colonial Filipe de Oliveira in 1624 A.D. The fourth and the present temple was constructed in 1734 A.D. during the Dutch colonial era by Ragunatha Maapaana Mudaliyar, who served as a Shroff in the Dutch Katchery, in a place identified then as the 'Kurukkal Valavu. Krishnaiyar a Brahmin, served as the first priest of the temple.
        
        The temple has the main entrance facing the East. It has an ornately carved five-storied tower or Gopuram in the Dravidian architecture style at the main entrance. In the Northern side a big holy garden is found. The Kalas Abhishekam of the nine-storied Gopuram ('Shanmuha Raja Gopuram') at Southern entrance was held on 21st August 2011. Another New Raja Gopuram was unveiled on 04 September 2015, creating a new Northern entrance to the temple complex. It is known as 'Gubera Raja Gopuram', and the entrance named 'Kubera Vaasal'.</p>
