    <h2>North Central Province </h2>

    <h4>North Central Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.</h4>
    <h3>Sri Maha Bodhi</h3>
    <p>The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is one of the most ancient trees which are living even today standing tall in the Mahamewna Gardens in Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. The tree is believed to have sprouted from a cutting brought from Bodh Gaya in India, where Gautama Buddha had attained enlightenment. The tree is an authentic and living link to Gautama Buddha and is often respected as the oldest tree in history which has a recorded date of the plantation.

        This ancient Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree has been protected and cared for by many years by the ancient kings and queens as well as the Buddhist monks. Today the tree is surrounded by statues, water canals and golden fences which make the site even more holy and spiritual enhancing its natural beauty. Although the tree is sacred for the Buddhists, many people belonging to other religions also pay a visit to the tree to immerse themselves in the tranquil beauty and to get a sense of calm from their day to day life.
        
        Another prominent feature is the Prarthana Bo tree. Many devotees believe that this tree has the power to grant the wishes of every person who pays a visit to the complex. The Buddhists make many offerings and vow at this sacred fig tree till today. The Sri Maha Bodhi tree is the most sacred tree in Sri Lanka and is revered and respected by Buddhists in Sri Lanka and all over the world.
        
        There are sermon sessions organized every day, where the Buddhist devotees visit the premises of the tree. On this occasion, you will find the atmosphere filled with the fragrance of the incense sticks and the burning of the oil lamps. We recommend visiting the Sri Maha Bodhi tree in the morning when one can make the most of the visit by participating in the rituals and also witnessing the breathtaking sunrise over the city.</p>
        <h3>Ruwanweliseya</h3>
<p>The Ruwanweliseya stupa is one of the largest stupas or dagobas, which is in the heart of the beautiful heritage city of Anuradhapura. This magnificent stupa was built by King Dutugamunu, who was hailed to be the hero of the island. The Ruwanweliseya stupa is also known as the Maha stupa and is one of the most adorned structures of the people of Sri Lanka.

    Today the Ruwanweliseya stupa stands tall with a height of 338 feet and a diameter of 951 ft. The stupa is surrounded by large paved courts and platforms which add to the beauty of the place. Initially, on the outer side of the boundary of the wall is a complete circle of elephants, made out of the brickwork. Till today, there are many renovations which have taken place from time which has made the Ruwanweliseya stupa is one of the most revered and influential areas of worship for the Buddhists in Anuradhapura.</p>
