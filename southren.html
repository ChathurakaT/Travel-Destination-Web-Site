    <h2> Southern Province </h2>

    <h4>The Southern Province of Sri Lanka is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils. </h4>
   
    <h3>Hikkaduwa Coral Reef</h3>

    <p>The Hikkaduwa coral reef or National Park consists of a network of fringing reefs around the southern area of the island, specifically near the city of Hikkaduwa. The Hikkaduwa beach is a popular destination for both locals and tourists and the reef is a wonder all in itself. As for the national park itself, the reef was declared as a wildlife sanctuary on May 18th, 1979. Finally it was open to the public as a protected nature reserve in 2002, on the 19th of September. On average, the depth of the reef is about 16 feet, perfect for coral growth as they harbor photosynthetic algae inside.

        The best times to visit the Hikkaduwa coral reef would be when the water is clear and there is less chance of storms, particularly between the months of April and November. Snorkeling and scuba tours are the most common excursions here while one can also charter glass-bottomed boats. Yet tourists must be responsible enough to respect the reef and its inhabitants. For one, collecting live animals is not encouraged and neither is walking on the corals. While their skeletons are composed of hard limestone they are still living organisms and are still fragile.  Being a fringing reef, the Hikkaduwa Coral Reef lessens the effect of coastal erosion by acting as a blockade. The coast extends for just four kilometers outwards. In terms of size, it covers about 102 hectares. Among the corals that grow here, there are elkhorn, table, staghorn and brain corals, all of them being hard coral species which form the very foundations of the reef. Altogether over sixty species make up the reef and these corals provide a home for many other organisms. Some are encrusting organisms like tunicates and marine sponges and all of these stationary invertebrates are filter feeders, straining in microscopic plankton through their body cavities.
        
        Corals however have tentacled polyps for this purpose. Other, more active creatures include tiny, colorful crabs, shrimp, octopuses and starfish, often with interesting interrelationships among both one another and the corals themselves. Many are small enough to live inside the spaces in the corals’ limestone skeletons. There are 170 species of reef fish found at Hikkaduwa coral reef. Many ornamental saltwater aquarium species like sea goldies, damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish and species of wrasse make their home among the corals. Gobies, dragonets, eels and blennies hide under the sand in generally coral-free areas while others live in cracks and crevices within the coral skeletons. Some of the larger fish include the rather dragon-like moray eels of which there are several species, and the ubiquitous blacktip reef shark. It is undoubtedly the apex predator of the shallow reefs. These sharks, at about five to six feet at maximum, are generally harmless but may bite if provoked or due to curiosity on hearing slashing noises. They are less likely to go for submerged swimmers in deeper water. So far no blacktip attacks have resulted in a fatality, although it is still important to give these animals a wide berth. Younger individuals range into shallow lagoon environs while the larger adults hunt in seagrass beds and on the deep outer slopes of the reef.
        
        Another group of animals to watch out for at Hikkaduwa coral reef are the many species of lionfish that hunt among the corals. Though small, their spiny fins carry deadly poisons and they advertise this toxin via an elaborate threat display.
        
        Seagrasses are vital coastal environs for many pelagic animals. They are often breeding grounds for some of the bigger, faster commercial fish such as tuna and trevally. Even larger reef predators like groupers and snappers breed in the shallows. Their young live around the seagrass, the only flowering plant to grow in a marine environment and unrelated to conventional seaweed like kelp and wrack. Some of them move into the mangroves but many hunt smaller animals among the grass stalks. Turtles are also largely pelagic but break into the seagrass beds to graze. Three species visit these waters, namely the hawksbill, Olive Ridley and the nearly cosmopolitan green turtles.</p>
        <h3>Bundala National Park</h3>
        <p>Each and every species of waterbird found in Sri Lanka is believed to visit Bundala National Park. Nearly 200 species of birds have been recorded within the park, out of which 58 species are migratory birds.

            During September and March, hoards of migrants arrive in Bundala; among them are Marsh and Curlew Sandpiper, Curlew and Greenshank Golden and Kentish Plover, Large and Lesser Sandplovers. While the Broad-billed Sandpiper and Red-necked Phalarope are the rare visitors, the most famous migratory bird is the greater flamingo. Hoards of flamingoes are one of the most common sights. In this period over 10,000 shorebirds might be feeding at any one day.
            
            The lagoons at the park attract a great variety of aquatic birds: among them are ibis, pelicans, painted storks, Black-necked Stork, terns, gulls, sand-pipers, snipes, teals, egrets, and spoonbills. Endemic birds include the Brown-capped Babbler, Ceylon Woodshrike, and Ceylon Junglefowl.Bundala is home to 32 species of mammals. Among them are civets, wild boars, Grey & Ruddy mongoose, porcupine, giant Indian palm squirrels, black-naped hares, Spotted Deer, Wild buffalo, the endemic, jackal and fishing & Rusty Spotted cats. While most commonly seen mammals are the hordes of grey langur and Toque Macaque.Bundala National Park shelters a small population of elephants that varies between 25 and 60 depending on the season.Bundala National Park is a habitat for several species of Reptiles. Bundala abounds with estuarine crocodile and mugger crocodile. The coastal area attracts Loggerhead Turtle, Green Turtle, Hawk’s bill turtle, and Olive Ridley: four out of Sri Lanka’s five marine turtle species, which come ashore to lay their eggs Between October and January. Watching egg-laying turtles in the night, on the beaches of Bundala is a sight that no visitor would forget in his lifetime.Among the 383 species of plants that have been recorded in Bundala, six are endemic species. Seven are nationally threatened. The prominent species are Weera (Drypetes Sepiaria), Palu( Manikara Hexandra), Satin (Chloroxylon Sweitenia), Kohomba (Azadirachta Indica), and Divul (Limonia acidissima). The dominant scrub is Andara.</p>
