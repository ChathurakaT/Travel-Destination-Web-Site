    <h2>Sabaragamuwa Province  </h2>

    <h4>The Sabaragamuwa Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.</h4>
    <h3>Adam's Peak</h3>
    <p>The range of Samanala Mountains which is honorably illuminated in central uplands is about 2243 meters high. Among all the sacred Buddhist places in Sabaragamuwa, Adam’s Peak is prior as it is believed that Lord Buddha’s sacred left foot-print is imprinted there on peak. In reference to Mahawanshaya (a celebrated history of the dynasties of the kings of Ceylon), during his third journey to Sri Lanka Lord Buddha has set the sacred foot-print on top of the Adam’s Peak by Sumana Deva’s (God Saman) invitation who descended from divine lineage to be the mayor of the region at that time. He achieved the great state of fruition after listening to Lord Buddha’s preaching and, from then on, he was worshiped, honored and respectfully titled as “Sumana Saman Devi Raja” by people of Sabaragamuwa region. Through Esala Maha Perahara ceremony annually held by Maha Saman Devale in Sabaragamuwa also with royal patronage and assistance, Buddhist community even today expresses their gratitude and greatly admires his service for the whole Buddhist community in Sri Lanka. In the bygone period of kings, it was really hard and very dangerous to make a pilgrimage to Adam’s Peak through dreadful, murderous and menacing wild. How hard the pilgrimage was that, as folklores indicate, people gave up their desire for life, shared full right of their property among their children and made vows to god Saman expecting life-security before they start the journey. One must have to make a very difficult journey about 8 miles through a narrow foot-path, which is considered as Raja Mawatha that lies through Palaabathgala in Ratnapura. As far as the difficulty is concerned, the path through Erathna from Kuruvita to Adiyalama is also not inferior to the previous. The Hatton-Nallathanni road, which is comfortable to a certain extent as there is the capability of making half of the journey by vehicles, is more famous today. The sacred sculpture of Saman Deva, the sacred relic-shrine and god’s ornaments are taken in procession starting from Galapoththawela Raja Maha Viharaya in Pelmadulla and ending up in the sacred Sri Pada compound. The path of this procession is the easiest Hatton Nallathanni road. That gives the commence to the season of worshiping the sacred foot-print of Lord Buddha at Adam’s Peak, and for the pilgrims it makes a spring out of season. Though the fragrance of fresh breeze purified by the dews of drizzle, the pleasant view of ever-green forests, the never-ending songs of little birds, the beauty of various types of Orchids which are endemic only in Sri Pada, the rareness of herbal plants like Kidaram (Amorphophallus campanulatus), Jatamansa (spikenard or Nardostachys jatamansi), Ayanuwel, Iyanuwel, Kudahedaya (Lycopodium squarosum), Mahahedaya (club-moss or Lycopodium phlegmaria), Iraraja (Zenxine regia), Sandaraja (Hypericum japonicum) and Wanaraja (forest-King or Anaectochilus regalis) which add more to the value and beauty of Sri Pada and also the darkness and dreadfulness of wild, which is always there hidden under the silence and calmness of the jungle, are disturbed by the pilgrims, the scene of their unity making a sacred procession from bottom up to the peak of Sri Pada through the forest, adds mare life, more beauty and most of all humanity illuminating the darkness of wild. These pilgrims come from every corner of Sri Lanka and unite to make the journey successful helping each other by being kind and friendly even without knowing the whereabouts of each other. Their devotion, humanity and piety fill the whole forest with beauty, life and compassion. On the other hand, this sacred place becomes an alluring, magnificent paradise which attracts tourists. The feat of climbing to the peak of Sri Pada with a great difficulty suffering from freezing coldness, the attainment of worshiping the sacred foot-print of Lord Buddha with a great devotion, and the performance of observing the magnificent view of sunrise called “Ira Sevaya”, while resting a little near ever-lightening lamp for all the year (Dolos mahe pahana), are unforgettable experiences that rise the enthusiasm, appreciation and allegiance in mind. This wonderful season of Sri Pada pilgrimage ends in six months. God’s ornaments are brought back in  procession to Thalpoththavela temple at Wesak poyaday in May. Thereby the whole environment that was filled with echoes of the entreaty of “Sadu” and peoples’ voices goes back to its usual calmness and silence of Mother Nature and once again it becomes a kingdom of wild animals. During off season, due to the threat of heavy rain, lightning strikes and attacks of wild animals, it is entirely impossible to worship Sri Pada. Among the royals who have cleared the path to Sri Pada that was almost covered by a thick forest, the service King Vijayabandu I (1055-1111 A.D.) had rendered is very important and note-worthy. He has done a memorable service for the convenience of pilgrims by erecting wayside rests and alms-halls mile by mile, constructing the way by building bridges and stair-cases, building up a parapet-wall around the compound of Sri Pada and providing land and village grants for the maintenance of Sri Pada. Information about his great service is recollected in Gilimale and Ambagamuwa epigraphs, which were erected by this great King and also in some descriptions in Mahawanshaya (name of a celebrated history of the dynasties of the kings of Ceylon). It is also mentioned that King Parakumba I has built a pagoda in the name of God Saman and King Parakumba II has built bridges and reconstructed the road on behalf of pilgrims. The service done by King Kirthi Sri Nishshankamalla is also historically note-worthy. He presented a village named Gilimale to pilgrims and supplied enough food and also constructed the road to make the odyssey more comfortable. This factor is verified in the content of epigraphs that were erected all over the country by this great King and proved by the content of Panduwas Nuwara enthroning letter. His pilgrimage to Sri Pada has been appreciated and honored even in the Rameshwaram letter. Sri Pada is denoted as Adam’s Peak by Christians, Sivanolipadam by Hindus and Al Ruhun by Muslims. Likewise all Sri Lankans irrespective of their religion worship Sri Pada considering this place as very holly and sacred in the light of their own beliefs. From the King Alexander the Great, who has added iron chains in constructing the road to Sri Pada to facilitate most of the foreigners who visited this sacred place time to time, have written various interesting, socially and religiously very epoch-making tidings about Sri Pada. Ibn Batuta, Suleiman (Islamic), Barbosa, Kwerose, Ruberio (Portuguese), Robert Knox, John Davy (English), Fa Hien, Wajira Buddhi, Xuanzang , Chingo (Chinese) and Hayet (Germen) are also few of them who visited and made important documentations about Adam’s Peak. Apart from them, governors like Robert Brownrigg and Wilmot Horton and more famous people like Henry Marshal and Skinner too have left important written reports on what they have seen. The jurisdiction of Sri Pada which was authorized by Buddhist monks taking much effort and a long time has unfortunately gone into the hands of Hindus in the reign of King Sithawaka Rajasingha. In this era, properties of Buddhist people have been disgracefully looted from them. Over the strong attempt of venerable Pindapathika Asarana Sarana Saranangkara Thero, Sri Pada has been again turned into a right of Buddhist in the reign of King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha. Sri Pada, as a right assigned to Pelmadulla Vehalle Dhammadinna ascetic generation, even today, is authorized by throes of that generation.</p>
    <h3>SINHARAJA RAIN FOREST</h3>    
    <p>Sinharaja rain forest can be mentioned as an invaluable bio-diversity hotspot and as a tropical ever-green hilly virgin rain forest that is located in south-west lowland wet-eco region in Sri Lanka. This is the biggest and the only virgin rainforest remain in low-country unto now. The dense vegetation spreads over 11187 ha passing the borders of three Districts namely Ratnapura, Galle and Matara. This biosphere reserve is positioned in between north latitude 6º21´-6º27´ and east longitude 80º21´-80º37´. There are four approaches to pass into this treasure trove. They are Ratnapura – Weddagala route, Ratnapura-Rakwana-Sooriyakanda-Ilumbakanda route, Hiniduma – Neluwa route and Deniyaya-Pallegama route. Although it is significant that the treasures of this rainforest belong to Ratnapura District and the main entrance to Sinharaja also opens at Ratnapura. The reserve is only 21 km long, maximally 7 km and minimally 3 km wide. It stretches in a hilly land in between 10º-35º and situated 100-200 m higher from sea-level. A considerable area of this hilly virgin forest belongs to low-country wet-zone that locates less than 1,000 m high from sea-level and the lock of land that belongs to hill-country is located more than 1,000 m high from sea-level. Sinharaja forest stands apart from central mountains. The eco-region is replete with rolling hills that runs parallel with several villages. The highest peak in this treasure trove is Hinipitigala Mountain, which stands 1,171 m high. 2,723 ha were designated as “Sinharaja Mookalana” according to no. 4046 gazette notification in 8th May, 1875. In 1978, Sinharaja forest was denominated as a “Man and Bio-sphere Reserve” and nominated as a heritage site in 1988. Sinharaja forest, which was designated as a world heritage site in 1989, is the first dense vegetation that was honored by this esteem in Sri Lanka. The annual rainfall would count 3,000- Signature of Sri Lanka 191 6,000 mm and the average temperature is about 23-25 Cº. There are 8 peaks that rise higher than 600 m. Sinharaja forest is encircled by 22 villages and the two villages namely Warukandeniya and Kolonthotuwa are located interior this tropical evergreen forest. There are several bruits that unfold the legend of the title “Sinharaja” among villagers around this natural site.
