    <h2> Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority</h2>

    <h4>Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) is the government authority tasked with planning, development, regulation, and policy implementation of tourism and related industries. Prior to SLTDA being established in 2007, these functions primarily resided with the organization known as Ceylon Tourist Board/Sri Lanka Tourist Board/Sri Lanka Tourism Board.</h4>
    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <p>In 1966, the Government of Sri Lanka decided to develop tourism in a planned and systematic manner, after identifying the need to set up an institutional framework. The Ceylon Tourist Board, (created by the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No. 10 of 1966,) and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation, (created by Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act of 1966,) were set up to enable this.<br>
Created to promote economic development through the development of foreign tourism, the Ceylon Tourist Board (CTB) was a statutory body that allowed greater freedom in decision making and flexibility in financial management. The first Board of the Ceylon Tourist Board were Mr. A.C.H. De Soysa, Mr. H.W. Jayawardana QC, Mr. Ralph Deraniyagala, Mr. Upali Senanayaka, Dr. P.R. Thyagaraja, Mr. Chandra Cooray (nominee of the Ministry of Finance) and the Commissioner of Local Government as a representative of Local Government.<br>
            The Ceylon Hotels Corporation was a Joint Stock Company with public and private sector involvement. It was intended to be the commercial arm of the Government for the purpose of developing accommodation and other facilities for tourists.<br>    
        The Tourist Development Act of 1968 provided the Ceylon Tourist Board with the statutory authority to develop tourism in a planned and controlled basis. The Tourist Development Act allowed the Ceylon Tourist Board to obtain land (through compensation) for development purposes. The Act also conferred powers for the Protection of Highways and Places of Scenic Beauty and vested authority in the Ceylon Tourist Board for the Registration and Classification of Tourist Hotels and all other tourist services.</p>
