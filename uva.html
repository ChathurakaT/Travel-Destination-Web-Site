    <h2>Uva Province </h2>

    <h4>Uva Province is Sri Lanka's second least populated province, with 1,259,880 people, created in 1896. It consists of two districts: Badulla and Moneragala. The provincial capital is Badulla. Uva is bordered by the Eastern, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, and Central provinces</h4>
    <h3>Little Adam's Peak</h3>
    <p>Our second hike in Ella was to Little Adam`s Peak, which we did in between the two longer ones. We did this trip without a guide. It is a fairly easy hike and the path is marked by signs so it`s easy to find, and very popular among tourists! So expect to meet many other people from all over the world on this trip! On the two other more remote trips we did in Ella, we hardly met anybody, just some locals now and then.

        The Little Adam`s Peak got it`s named after it`s big brother, the holy mountain Adam`s Peak, because of the similar shape. Adam`s Peak is further west in Sri Lanka, close to Nuwara Eliya, and is 2243 m high and a much more exhausting and more challenging climb! The mountain has however three names; Adam`s Peak (this is where Adam first set foot on earth after being cast out of heaven), Sri Pada (Buddha`s footprint left by the Buddha as he headed towards paradise) and Samanalakande (Butterfly mountain, where butterflies go to die). We had plans of climbing Big Adam`s Peak, but Espen hurt his knee so we settled for the “little brother” instead.
        
        The path up the hill to Little Adam`s Peak is easy to find and is marked by signs showing the way next to the 98 Acres Resort, to the right of this white Buddha.</p>

        <h3>Nine Arches Bridge</h3> 
        <p>Commissioned under the British in the year 1921, the Nine Arch Bridge stands proudly, a testament to the engineering and architectural brilliance of the early 20th century. Ideally placed between the Ella and Demodara railway station, those choosing to walk along the bridge will be presented with scenes of rolling hills and dense jungle to delight in.

            The Nine Arch Bridge, also known as the ‘Bridge in the Sky’ was constructed by connecting two bog mountains when constructing the Badulla – Colombo railway. This bridge is 300 feet in length, 25 feet in width and 80-100 feet in height. It is one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country. The Bridge can be reached by travelling 2km on Gotuwala road starting from Halpe Textile centre in Badulla Bandarawela road. The surrounding area has seen a steady increase in tourism due to the bridge’s architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby hillsides.
            
            Arguably the best time to venture out would be during when the locomotives come barrelling along and thus it is advisable to check on the train schedule in advance. However, be sure to carry your trusty cam with you so that you might capture every moment that unravels before you.</p>
